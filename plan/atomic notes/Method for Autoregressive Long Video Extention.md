**Idea/Argument:**
	Head condition can be different forms, including (i) a single image frame latent, (ii) the final latent from the previous clip, or (iii) a longer latent clip segment

If using only the previous image, then the auto regressive generation has a quality collapse -> no memory...
If using the previous latent, it has a control degradation,
